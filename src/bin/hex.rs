    NAME
        hex - read a binary file and output it in hexadecimal representation.
    SYNOPSIS
        hex [-h | --help] [-d | --decode] [FILE]
    DESCRIPTION
        This utility will read the file from the path given in the argument. If no argument is given, 'hex' will read from the standard input. The content of the file is then encoded/decoded in/from hexadecimal.

        In opposite to GNU Hexdump, 'hex' will treat the input as big endianness left-to-right byte stream. Furthermore, there is no stylistic representation, the output is just plain ASCII, with no spaces or new-lines for seperations.
    OPTIONS
        -h
        --help
            Print this manual page.
        -d
        --decode
            Decode hexadecimal.
